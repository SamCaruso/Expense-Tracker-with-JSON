# Expense-Tracker-with-JSON

An Expense Tracker built in Python that allows the user to enter an initial budget, then add, edit and remove expenses and credits, and view a detailed breakdown of their budget. It is designed to store and show entries chronologically, not alphabetically or based on their amount. The data can then be saved to a json file, which will be automatically accessed the next time the program is run
